## Methods

<h3 id="compile">compile</h3>

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tensorflow/similarity/blob/master/tensorflow_similarity/matchers/classification_match.py#L60-L73">View source</a>

```python
compile(
    distance_thresholds: Optional[<a href="../../TFSimilarity/callbacks/FloatTensor.md">TFSimilarity.callbacks.FloatTensor```
</a>] = None
)
```


Configures the distance thresholds used during matching.

<tr>
<td>
<b>distance_thresholds</b>
</td>
<td>
The max distance below which a nearest neighbor
is considered a valid match. A threshold of math.inf is used if None
is passed.

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tensorflow/similarity/blob/master/tensorflow_similarity/matchers/classification_match.py#L162-L201">View source</a>

```python
compute_count(
    query_labels: <a href="../../TFSimilarity/callbacks/IntTensor.md">TFSimilarity.callbacks.IntTensor```
</a>,
    lookup_labels: <a href="../../TFSimilarity/callbacks/IntTensor.md">TFSimilarity.callbacks.IntTensor```
</a>,
    lookup_distances: <a href="../../TFSimilarity/callbacks/FloatTensor.md">TFSimilarity.callbacks.FloatTensor```
</a>
) -> None
```


Computes the match counts at each of the distance thresholds.

This method computes the following at each distance threshold.

* True Positive: The query label matches the derived lookup label and
the derived lookup distance is <= the current distance threshold.

* False Positive: The query label does not match the derived lookup
label but the derived lookup distance is <= the current distance
threshold.

* False Negative: The query label matches the derived lookup label but
the derived lookup distance is > the current distance threshold.

* True Negative: The query label does not match the derived lookup
label and the derived lookup distance is > the current distance
threshold.

Note: compile must be called before calling match.

Derive a match label and distance from a set of K neighbors.

For each query, derive a single match label and distance given the
associated set of lookup labels and distances.
