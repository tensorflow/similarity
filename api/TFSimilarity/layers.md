# Module: TFSimilarity.layers





Specialized Similarity `keras.layers`



## Classes

- [`class ActivationStdLoggingLayer`](../TFSimilarity/layers/ActivationStdLoggingLayer.md): Computes the mean std of the activations of a layer.

- [`class FloatTensor`](../TFSimilarity/callbacks/FloatTensor.md): Float tensor 

- [`class GeneralizedMeanPooling`](../TFSimilarity/layers/GeneralizedMeanPooling.md): This is the class from which all layers inherit.

- [`class GeneralizedMeanPooling1D`](../TFSimilarity/layers/GeneralizedMeanPooling1D.md): Computes the Generalized Mean of each channel in a tensor.

- [`class GeneralizedMeanPooling2D`](../TFSimilarity/layers/GeneralizedMeanPooling2D.md): Computes the Generalized Mean of each channel in a tensor.

- [`class IntTensor`](../TFSimilarity/callbacks/IntTensor.md): Integer tensor

- [`class MetricEmbedding`](../TFSimilarity/layers/MetricEmbedding.md): Just your regular densely-connected NN layer.
