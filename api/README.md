# TensorFlow Similarity API Documentation

TensorFlow Similarity is a TensorFlow library focused on making metric learning easy




![TensorFlow Similarity Overview](../assets/images/tfsim_overview.png)


TensorFlow Similiarity, as visible in the diagram above, offers the following
components to help research, train, evaluate and serve metric models:

- **`SimilarityModel()`**: This class subclasses the `tf.keras.model` class and extends it with additional properties that are useful for metric learning. For example it adds the methods:
  1. `index()`: Enables indexing of the embedding
  2. `lookup()`: Takes samples, calls predict(), and searches for neighbors within the index.
  3. `calibrate()`: Calibrates the model's index search thresholds using a calibration metric and a test dataset.

- **`MetricLoss()`**:  This virtual class, that extends the `tf.keras.Loss` class, is the base class from which Metric losses are derived. This sub-classing ensures proper error checking; that is, it ensures the user is using a loss metric to train the models, performs better static analysis, and enforces additional constraints such as having a distance function that is supported by the index. Additionally, Metric losses make use of the fully tested and highly optimized pairwise distances functions provided by TensorFlow Similarity that are available under the `Distances.*` classes.

- **`Samplers()`**: Samplers are meant to ensure that each batch has at least n (with n >=2) examples of each class, as losses such as TripletLoss canâ€™t work properly if this condition is not met. TensorFlow Similarity offers an in-memory sampler for small dataset and a `tf.data.TFRecordDataset` for large scales one.

- **`Indexer()`**: The Indexer and its sub-components are meant to index known embeddings alongside their metadata. The embedding metadata is stored within `Table()`, while the `Matcher()` is used to perform [fast approximate neighbor searches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search) that are meant to quickly retrieve the indexed elements that are the closest to the embeddings supplied in the `lookup()` and `single_lookup()` function.

The default `Index()` sub-compoments run in-memory and are optimized to be used in interactive settings such as Jupyter notebooks, Colab, and metric computation during training (e.g using the `EvalCallback()` provided). Index are serialized as part of `model.save()` so you can reload them via `model.index_load()` for serving purpose or further training / evaluation.

The default implementation can scale up to medium deployment (1M-10M+ points) easily, provided the computers have enough memory. For very large scale deployments you will need to sublcass the compoments to match your own architetctue. See FIXME colab to see how to deploy TensorFlow Similarity in production.
