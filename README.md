# TensorFlow Similarity

TensorFlow Similarity is a (https://tensorflow.org)[TensorFLow] package
focused on making training and using similarity deep-learning models easy.

## Getting Started

Use pip to install the library

```python
pip install tensorflow_similarity
```

Then checkout the [hello world notebook](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/drive/1HRK4zLSAzGHwoM6dz2A1ygHSeVQ3VHdI#scrollTo=ST8JbEUrldut) that will shows you
how to use TensorFlow Similarity to train and use a Similarity model on
MNIST dataset.
