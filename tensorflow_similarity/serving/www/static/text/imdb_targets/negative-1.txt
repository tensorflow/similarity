shown in australia as this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become and have to watch it to the end just to see if it could get any worse and it does the storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school class the sets are pathetic but better than the and the acting is wooden br br the  seems to have been stolen from the props of  there didn't seem to be a single original idea in the whole movie br br i found this movie to be so bad that i laughed most of the way through br br malcolm mcdowell should hang his head in shame he obviously needed the money
