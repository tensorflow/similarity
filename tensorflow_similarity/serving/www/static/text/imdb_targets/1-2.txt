<START> the first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama i love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters explaining just enough to stay excited of course this show has some flaws in the first two series there are some characters who for some reason don't show up in the third season many of the characters have a decent sent off but some of them just aren't there like rose and her husband where the hell are they what happened to them maybe they will return in later episodes but it is a little inconsistent that being said lost manages to be thrilling every episode especially the first two seasons that is a very hard thing to do i do notice that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mystery aspects of the show this is not a bad thing it even saves some episodes from getting boring one of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters you will grow to love these characters good or bad but eventually i will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure the danger of lost getting canceled due to <UNK> ratings is near and that would be devastating
