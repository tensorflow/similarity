i caught this at a test screening all i can say is what the hell this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for scarface it's bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense and even if you do leave your brain in the car the film is still so bizarre that it isn't even funny br br the plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to save a crocodile which contains a cia the cia comes after irwin to get their back irwin mistakes them for and sets out to stop them br br that's about all the story there is the rest is over the top of australian culture see and and strangely choreographed action sequences at one point irwin a  and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it yes that's right steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film
