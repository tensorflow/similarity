        well balanced. That is, each batch aims to contain
        `examples_per_class_per_batch` examples of `classes_per_batch` classes.

        The `batch_size` used during training will be equal to:
        `classes_per_batch` * `examples_per_class_per_batch` unless an
        `augmenter` that alters the number of examples returned is used. Then
        the batch_size is a function of how many augmented examples are
        returned by the `augmenter`.


        Multishot samplers are to be used when you have multiple examples for
        the same class. If this is not the case, then see the
        [SingleShotMemorySampler()](single_memory.md) for using single examples
        with augmentation.

        Memory samplers are good for datasets that fit in memory. If you have
        larger ones that needs to sample from disk then use the
        [TFRecordDatasetSampler()](tfdataset_sampler.md)
