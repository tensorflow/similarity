"""Data Samplers that generate balanced batches for smooth training.

TensorFlow Similarity provides data samplers for various types of datasets and
use cases that:
- Ensure that batches contain at least N examples of each class present in the batch.
- Support restricting the batches to a subset of the classes present in the dataset.
