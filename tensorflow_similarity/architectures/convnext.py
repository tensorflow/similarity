     Args:
        input_shape: Size of the input image. Must match size of ConvNeXt version you use.
        See below for version input size.
        embedding_size: Size of the output embedding. Usually between 64
        and 512. Defaults to 128.
        variant: Which Variant of the ConvNeXt to use. Defaults to "BASE".
        weights: Use pre-trained weights - the only available currently being
        imagenet. Defaults to "imagenet".
        trainable: Make the ConvNeXt backbone fully trainable or partially
        trainable.
        - "full" to make the entire backbone trainable,
        - "partial" to only make the last 3 block trainable
        - "frozen" to make it not trainable.
        l2_norm: If True and include_top is also True, then
        tfsim.layers.MetricEmbedding is used as the last layer, otherwise
        keras.layers.Dense is used. This should be true when using cosine
        distance. Defaults to True.
        include_top: Whether to include the fully-connected layer at the top
        of the network. Defaults to True.
        pooling: Optional pooling mode for feature extraction when
        include_top is False. Defaults to gem.
        - None means that the output of the model will be the 4D tensor
          output of the last convolutional layer.
        - avg means that global average pooling will be applied to the
          output of the last convolutional layer, and thus the output of the
          model will be a 2D tensor.
        - max means that global max pooling will be applied.
        - gem means that global GeneralizedMeanPooling2D will be applied.
          The gem_p param sets the contrast amount on the pooling.
        gem_p: Sets the power in the GeneralizedMeanPooling2D layer. A value
        of 1.0 is equivalent to GlobalMeanPooling2D, while larger values
        will increase the contrast between activations within each feature
        map, and a value of math.inf will be equivalent to MaxPool2d.
