    """Build an ResNet50 Model backbone for similarity learning

    Architecture from [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)

    Args:
        input_shape: Size of the image input prior to augmentation,
        must be bigger than the size of ResNet version you use. See below for
        min input size of 244.

        embedding_size: Size of the output embedding. Usually between 64
        and 512. Defaults to 128.

        weights: Use pre-trained weights - the only available currently being
        imagenet. Defaults to "imagenet".

        trainable: Make the ResNet backbone fully trainable or partially
        trainable.
        - "full" to make the entire backbone trainable,
        - "partial" to only make the last conv5_block trainable
        - "frozen" to make it not trainable.

        l2_norm: If True and include_top is also True, then
        tfsim.layers.MetricEmbedding is used as the last layer, otherwise
        keras.layers.Dense is used. This should be true when using cosine
        distance. Defaults to True.

        include_top: Whether to include the fully-connected layer at the top
        of the network. Defaults to True.

        pooling: Optional pooling mode for feature extraction when
        include_top is False. Defaults to gem.
        - None means that the output of the model will be the 4D tensor
          output of the last convolutional layer.
        - avg means that global average pooling will be applied to the
          output of the last convolutional layer, and thus the output of the
          model will be a 2D tensor.
        - max means that global max pooling will be applied.
        - gem means that global GeneralizedMeanPooling2D will be applied.
          The gem_p param sets the contrast amount on the pooling.

        gem_p: Sets the power in the GeneralizedMeanPooling2D layer. A value
        of 1.0 is equivelent to GlobalMeanPooling2D, while larger values
        will increase the contrast between activations within each feature
        map, and a value of math.inf will be equivelent to MaxPool2d.
