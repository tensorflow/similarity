    A query is counted as a positive when ANY lookup in top K match the query

        name: Name associated with the metric object, e.g., recall@5

        canonical_name: The canonical name associated with metric,
        e.g., recall@K

        k: The number of nearest neighbors over which the metric is computed.

        distance_threshold: The max distance below which a nearest neighbor is
        considered a valid match.

        average: {'micro'} Determines the type of averaging performed over the
        queries.

        * 'micro': Calculates metrics globally over all queries.
        * 'macro': Calculates metrics for each label and takes the unweighted
        mean.

        drop_closest_lookup: If True, remove the closest lookup before computing
        the metrics. This is used when the query set == indexed set.
