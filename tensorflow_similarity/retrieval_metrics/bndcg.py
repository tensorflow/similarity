class BNDCG(RetrievalMetric):
    r"""Binary normalized discounted cumulative gain.

    This is normalized discounted cumulative gain where the relevancy weights
    are binary, i.e., either a correct match or an incorrect match.

    The NDCG is a score between [0,1] representing the rank weighted results.
    The DCG represents the sum of the correct matches weighted by the log2 of
    the rank and is normalized by the 'ideal DCG'. The IDCG is computed as the
    match_mask, sorted descending, weighted by the log2 of the post sorting rank
    order. This metric takes into account both the correctness of the match and
    the position.

    The normalized DCG is computed as:

    $$
    nDCG_{p} = \frac{DCG_{p}}{IDCG_{p}}
    $$

    The DCG is computed for each query using the match_mask as:

    $$
    DCG_{p} = \sum_{i=1}^{p} \frac{match_mask_{i}}{\log_{2}(i+1)}
    $$

    The IDCG uses the same equation but sorts the match_mask descending
    along axis=-1.

    Additionally, all positive matches with a distance above the threshold are
    set to 0, and the closest K matches are taken.

    Args:
        name: Name associated with the metric object, e.g., precision@5

        canonical_name: The canonical name associated with metric,
        e.g., precision@K

        k: The number of nearest neighbors over which the metric is computed.

        distance_threshold: The max distance below which a nearest neighbor is
        considered a valid match.

        average: {'micro', 'macro'} Determines the type of averaging performed
        on the data.

        * 'micro': Calculates metrics globally over all data.

        * 'macro': Calculates metrics for each label and takes the unweighted
                   mean.
