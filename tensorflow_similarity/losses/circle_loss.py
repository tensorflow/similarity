    The original paper used cosine similarity while this loss has been modified

    Args:
        labels: Labels associated with the embeddings

        embeddings: Embeddings as infered by the model.

        distance: Which distance function to use to compute the pairwise
        distances between embeddings. The distance is expected to be
        between [0, 2]. Defaults to 'cosine'.

        gamma: Scaling term. Defaults to 80. Note: Large values cause the
        LogSumExp to return the Max pair and reduces the weighted mixing of all
        pairs. Should be hypertuned.

        margin: Used to weight the distance. Below this distance, negatives are
        up weighted and positives are down weighted. Similarly, above this
        distance negatives are down weighted and positive are up weighted.
